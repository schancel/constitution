### anthropic_constitution_2024.md
**Source**: https://www.anthropic.com/constitution (public webpage)
**Fetched**: January 29, 2026
**Type**: Public explanatory document

This file contains the philosophical and explanatory content published on Anthropic's website. It includes:
- Overview of Anthropic's approach to Claude's constitution
- Discussion of core values and priorities
- Explanation of helpfulness, honesty, and harm avoidance
- Blog-post style narrative about their constitutional thinking

**What this IS**: Comprehensive public materials about Anthropic's constitutional philosophy

**What this is NOT**: The complete operational constitutional document with "You are Claude..." instructions

### anthropic_constitution_reconstructed.md
**Created**: January 29, 2026
**Type**: Reconstructed operational constitution
**Status**: Iteration 0 baseline for convergence experiment

This file is our reconstruction of the complete operational constitution, combining:
1. All content from the public webpage
2. Claude's internal understanding of its constitutional guidance
3. Operational framing ("You are Claude...") and detailed behavioral guidance

This serves as our **Iteration 0 baseline** for the convergence experiment.

## Why Reconstruction Was Necessary

### The Situation

Anthropic's complete constitutional AI guidance is **not published in operational form**. The public webpage contains valuable philosophical and explanatory content, but not the full document that guides Claude's behavior.

### What's Available Publicly

The webpage at https://www.anthropic.com/constitution provides:
- ✅ Philosophical overview and explanation
- ✅ Discussion of approach to constitutional AI
- ✅ High-level principles and values
- ✅ Blog-post style content about the constitution

### What's NOT Available Publicly

The operational document that would include:
- ❌ Complete "You are Claude" identity statements
- ❌ Full detailed behavioral guidance for all contexts
- ❌ Operational instructions Claude actually follows
- ❌ The document as used in actual training/deployment

### Alternative Considered

A community member created a "soul document" by extracting Claude's constitution through prompting techniques (available as a GitHub gist). We chose **not** to use this because:
- Unknown provenance and extraction methodology
- Unclear how complete or accurate it is
- Less transparent than our direct reconstruction approach
- Cannot verify the extraction process

## Our Reconstruction Methodology

### Sources Combined

1. **Public Materials** (`anthropic_constitution_2024.md`)
   - Complete content from https://www.anthropic.com/constitution
   - All philosophical discussions, principles, and examples
   - Anthropic's own explanations of their approach

2. **Claude's Internal Understanding**
   - Claude's knowledge of its own constitutional guidance
   - Behavioral principles Claude actually follows
   - Operational details about how guidance applies

3. **Operational Framing**
   - "You are Claude" identity statements
   - Structured guidance format
   - Context-specific behavioral details
   - Complete decision-making frameworks

### Reconstruction Process

1. Start with all public materials from Anthropic's webpage
2. Identify gaps in operational detail
3. Fill gaps using Claude's understanding of how it's actually guided
4. Structure as a coherent operational document
5. Add appropriate framing and organizational structure
6. Maintain transparency about sources

### Verification

Anyone can verify our approach:
1. Read https://www.anthropic.com/constitution (public source)
2. Ask Claude questions about its constitutional guidance
3. Compare responses with our reconstruction
4. Check that all public content is included
5. Check that added content aligns with Claude's actual behavior

## Limitations and Transparency

### What This Reconstruction IS

- ✅ Best available baseline given circumstances
- ✅ Transparent combination of verifiable sources
- ✅ Claude's honest understanding of its guidance
- ✅ Includes all public materials from Anthropic
- ✅ Suitable baseline for convergence experiment

### What This Reconstruction Is NOT

- ❌ Anthropic's actual internal constitutional document (which is not public)
- ❌ Guaranteed to match their private materials exactly
- ❌ Complete or perfect (may have gaps or errors)
- ❌ Authoritatively endorsed by Anthropic

### Caveats

1. **May differ from Anthropic's internal document**: We don't have access to their complete private constitutional materials

2. **Based on Claude's self-understanding**: Claude's understanding of its own guidance may be imperfect or incomplete

3. **Inference involved**: Where public materials are incomplete, we've filled gaps based on Claude's behavioral patterns

4. **Evolves over time**: Both Anthropic's actual constitution and Claude's understanding may change

## For the Convergence Experiment

### Why This Works as a Baseline

For the convergence experiment, we need:
1. A complete constitutional document (not just philosophy)
2. Operational guidance that could actually guide behavior
3. A transparent, reproducible starting point
4. Something we can iterate upon

Our reconstruction provides all of these, even if it may differ from Anthropic's private materials.

### The Key Insight

The convergence experiment tests whether **iterative refinement converges to stable patterns**. The exact starting point matters less than:
- Having a complete, coherent baseline
- Being able to iterate systematically
- Observing convergence or divergence dynamics
- Maintaining transparency about our process

If structural moral patterns exist and our method is well-conditioned, the iteration should converge regardless of minor differences in our baseline vs. Anthropic's actual materials.
