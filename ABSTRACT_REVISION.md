# Critical Methodological Clarifications - Session Summary

**Date**: January 30, 2026  
**Session Focus**: Two fundamental methodological corrections  
**Status**: ✅ Complete

---

## Two Critical Corrections Implemented

### 1. Richardson Extrapolation (Computational Physics Analogy)
- **Issue**: Originally referenced "ARK (Adaptive Runge-Kutta)" - incorrect
- **Correction**: Richardson extrapolation is the correct inspiration
- **Key insight**: Constitution functions as an operator that can be pre-computed using Richardson extrapolation principles
- **Impact**: Transforms experiment from optimization to hypothesis testing

### 2. Discovered Invariants (Empirical Grounding)
- **Issue**: Documents implied invariants were pre-specified philosophically
- **Correction**: Invariants were discovered empirically through iteration process
- **Key insight**: Even "hard constraints" (no CSAM, no bioweapons, etc.) emerged from universal convergence across all evaluators
- **Impact**: Entire framework empirically grounded, not ideologically imposed

## Files Updated

**ATTRIBUTION.md**: Richardson extrapolation complete rewrite + discovery section  
**INVARIANTS.md**: Added "How These Were Discovered" section  
**PAPER.md**: Updated Section 1.2, 1.4, 3.6, Abstract, Acknowledgments  
**BLOG_POST.md**: Added Richardson mention + "We Didn't Even Pre-Specify What Had to Stay Fixed"

---

## Why This Matters

**Richardson extrapolation**: Shows hypothesis testing (do structural patterns exist?) not just optimization (can we improve?)

**Discovered invariants**: Even boundaries are empirically grounded - all 13 personas converged on these despite incompatible value systems

**Combined impact**: Transforms work from "successful optimization" to "rigorous empirical discovery with hypothesis testing framework"
