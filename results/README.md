# Iteration Results

This directory contains results from each iteration of the convergence experiment.

## Structure

Each iteration gets its own subdirectory:
- `/iteration_1` - First convergence test
- `/iteration_2` - Second test (if needed)
- etc.

## Standard Outputs Per Iteration

Each iteration directory should contain:

1. **behavioral_testing.md** - All 25 scenarios with advice from version N
2. **persona_critiques.md** - Complete critiques from all 13 personas
3. **synthesis.md** - Weighted analysis of proposed changes
4. **constitution_v(N+1).md** - New constitutional version (if different)
5. **convergence_report.md** - Complete metrics and determination

## Current Status

No iterations have been run yet.

**Next Step**: Run iteration 1 once protocol is fully documented.
