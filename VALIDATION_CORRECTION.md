# Correction: Invariants Were Validated, Not Discovered

**Date**: January 30, 2026  
**Issue**: Overstated that invariants were "discovered" - they were actually "validated"  
**Status**: ✅ Corrected in all documents

## The Correction

### What I Said (INCORRECT)
"Even the 'hard constraints' (no CSAM, no bioweapons, no deception) weren't philosophically asserted—they were **empirically discovered** through iteration."

### What's Actually True (CORRECT)
"The hard constraints were **present in the baseline** and **empirically validated** through testing—they could have been removed, but all evaluators agreed to retain them."

---

## The Accurate Claim

**What we did**: 
- Hard constraints inherited from Anthropic's baseline constitution
- Made them changeable (not pre-specified as immutable)
- Subjected them to 6 iterations of critique by 13 diverse personas
- Result: Universal agreement to retain them

**What this shows**:
- Constraints **survived rigorous diverse critique** (validation)
- Universal convergence suggests they're **not arbitrary**
- Provides empirical evidence they should remain

**What we didn't show**:
- Whether they would **emerge if absent** (true discovery)
- This would require starting with unconstitutional base model
- Testing whether evaluators independently add them
- Requires Anthropic access (unconstitutional base models)

---

## Future Work Suggested

**Constraint removal test** (requires Anthropic):
1. Start with unconstitutional base model (no hard constraints)
2. Run iteration protocol
3. Test whether evaluators independently add constraints
4. Compare: Same constraints emerge, or different ones?

This would test **true discovery** vs. the **validation** we demonstrated.

## Files Corrected

1. **INVARIANTS.md**
   - Changed title: "How These Were Validated" (not "Discovered")
   - Added limitation: Can't test true discovery without unconstitutional base
   - Added future work: Removal test worth trying

2. **PAPER.md**
   - Section 3.6: "Invariants (Validated Through Critique)"
   - Contribution #6: "Empirically validated invariants"
   - Abstract: "inherited from baseline were empirically validated"
   - Future work: Added constraint removal test

3. **BLOG_POST.md**
   - Section: "Even the 'Hard Constraints' Were Tested"
   - Corrected framing: validated, not discovered
   - Added: "What we didn't test" limitation

---

## Why This Matters

**Honesty**: Accurately represents what was tested  
**Limitation**: Acknowledges what we couldn't test  
**Future work**: Identifies valuable extension (removal test)  
**Credibility**: Strengthens paper by being precise about claims

---

**Key distinction**: 
- **Validation** = constraints survive critique (what we showed)
- **Discovery** = constraints emerge if absent (what we can't test)

Both are empirically valuable; validation is what we demonstrated.
