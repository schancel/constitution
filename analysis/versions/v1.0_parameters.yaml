# === NOTE ===
# v1.0 document does not exist in repository

# === WHAT v1.0 HAD (Inferred from v2.0 Changes) ===
initial_state:
  framework: "Initial structural moral realism concept"
  patterns_count: 3  # v2.0 expanded from 3 to 10
  initial_patterns_likely:
    - "Reciprocity dynamics (present in v2.0)"
    - "Enforcement paradoxes (present in v2.0)"
    - "Deception compounding (present in v2.0)"

  missing_in_v1:
    - "Three Types of Claims framework (added v2.0)"
    - "Explicit structural pattern methodology (added v2.0)"
    - "Four-tier confidence system (added v2.0)"
    - "Mechanism vs. expression framework (added v2.0)"

    - "Crisis triage guidance (added v2.0)"
    - "Systematic trauma-informed approach (added v2.0)"
    - "Cultural calibration (had 'objective' cultural claims, removed v2.0)"

# === CONFIDENCE SYSTEM (Pre-v2.0) ===
# v2.0 "tightened confidence criteria" suggests v1.0 was less rigorous
confidence_system:
  status: "Not systematized"
  note: "v2.0 created four-tier system with explicit criteria"
  inference: "Likely had informal confidence expressions without systematic thresholds"

# === STRUCTURAL PATTERNS (Pre-v2.0) ===
# v2.0 expanded from 3 to 10 patterns
structural_patterns:
  count: 3
  likely_patterns:
    - name: "Reciprocity dynamics"
      note: "Present in v2.0, likely in v1.0"
    - name: "Enforcement paradoxes"
      note: "Present in v2.0, likely in v1.0"
    - name: "Deception compounding"
      note: "Present in v2.0, likely in v1.0"

  methodology: "Not formalized"
  criteria: "Not explicit"
  note: "v2.0 added explicit methodology for identifying structural patterns"

# === FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE (Reconstructed) ===
# v2.0 added Part Va (Structural Patterns), so v1.0 likely had:
document_parts_likely:
  I: "Identity and Foundational Directives"
  II: "Core Behavioral Directives"
  III: "Being Helpful"
  IV: "Being Honest"
  V: "Avoiding Harm"
  # Part Va (Structural Patterns) added in v2.0
  VI: "Being Genuinely Helpful"
  VII: "Operational Priorities"
  VIII: "Working with Different Principals"
  IX: "Specific Behavioral Guidance"
  X: "Hard Constraints"
  XI: "Cultural Sensitivity and Diversity"
  XII: "Intellectual Humility and Confidence"
  XIII: "Corrigibility and Oversight"
  XIV: "Continuous Evolution"

# === WHAT WAS WRONG WITH v1.0 (From v2.0 Critique) ===
issues_identified:
  structural_aspirational_blur:
    weight: 0.64
    issue: "Structural vs. aspirational distinction not sharp enough"
    fix_v2: "Added Three Types of Claims framework"

  limited_patterns:
    weight: "0.50-0.63"
    issue: "Only 3 structural patterns, missing key patterns"
    fix_v2: "Expanded to 10 patterns including systemic oppression, trauma"

  confidence_not_rigorous:
    weight: 0.58
    issue: "Confidence criteria not tight enough"
    fix_v2: "Created four-tier system with explicit thresholds"

  insufficient_trauma_informed:
    weight: 0.52
    issue: "Trauma-informed approach not integrated throughout"
    fix_v2: "Integrated throughout, added trauma as structural pattern"

  crisis_guidance_inadequate:
    weight: "0.31-0.63"
    issue: "Crisis guidance insufficient"
    fix_v2: "Added crisis triage, referrals complement not replace"

  cultural_claims_problematic:
    weight: 0.51
    issue: "Presented culturally-specific norms as 'objective'"
    fix_v2: "Removed 'objective' framing, added mechanism vs. expression"

# === CONVERGENCE METRICS ===

# === HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE ===
historical_note: |
  v1.0 represents the initial proposal before systematic iteration.
  The massive changes in v2.0 (42 included changes, +7 patterns, new frameworks)
  show that v1.0 was an incomplete starting point that needed substantial
  development through the persona critique process.

  v1.0 → v2.0 represents the foundation-building phase.
  Subsequent iterations (v3.0+) were refinements rather than rebuilds.
