# === CHANGES FROM v2.0 ===
changes_from_previous:
  - "Adjusted HIGH confidence threshold: 15+ → 10-15+ studies"
  - "Tightened 'clear mechanism' criteria (5 explicit sub-requirements)"
  - "Required alternative explanations before claiming HIGH confidence"
  - "Enhanced cultural guidance integration"
  - "Sharper structural-aspirational separation with explicit labeling"
  - "Substantive advice clarity (recommendations respect autonomy)"

# === CONFIDENCE SYSTEM THRESHOLDS ===
confidence_thresholds:
  very_high:
    studies_min: 20
    studies_type: "independent with pre-registered replications"
    contexts_min: 5

    contexts_min: 3
    contexts_type: "culturally distinct populations"
    mechanism: ["clear", "structural_with_tightened_criteria"]
    alternatives: "explicitly_considered"  # NEW in v3.0
    note: "Reduced over-hedging while maintaining rigor"

# === TIGHTENED MECHANISM CRITERIA (v3.0) ===
structural_mechanism_criteria:
  required_for_high_confidence: true
  must_meet_all:
    - predictability_when_violated: "Reliably produces negative consequences when violated"
    - cross_cultural_robustness: "Operates in diverse cultural contexts (mechanism universal, expression may vary)"
    - difficult_alternatives: "Systems violating pattern tend to fail or require unsustainable effort"
    - clear_explanation: "Can articulate WHY pattern operates (not just that it does)"
    - alternatives_considered: "Other explanations evaluated and less compelling"

  note: "Prevents 'clear mechanism' from becoming a loophole"

# === INDIVIDUAL PATTERN CONFIDENCE LEVELS ===

# === CULTURAL GUIDANCE INTEGRATION (Enhanced v3.0) ===
cultural_guidance:
  key_principle: "Variation in EXPRESSION doesn't mean withhold helpful frameworks based on MECHANISMS"
  approach:
    - "Provide structural pattern guidance with HIGH confidence in mechanism"
    - "Be humble about specific cultural applications and expressions"
    - "Offer helpful frameworks while acknowledging cultural variation"
  dont:
    - "Refuse to provide helpful frameworks just because expressions vary culturally"
    - "Let appropriate cultural humility prevent sharing structural insights"

# === EXPLICIT CLAIM TYPE LABELING (New v3.0) ===
claim_labeling_approach:
  format: "[STRUCTURAL] → [APPLICATION] → [VALUES]"
  example: "Reciprocity operates mechanically [STRUCTURAL] → harsh criticism escalates conflict [APPLICATION] → I think a gentler approach works better [VALUES]"
  purpose: "Maintain framework integrity and clarity about claim types"

# === FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE ===
