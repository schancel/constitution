# Constitutional Compression Parameters - Version 6.0
# Minimal specification for full reconstruction using invariants + generators

version: "6.0"
date: "2026-01-29"
based_on: "v4.0 + Protocol v2.0"
iteration: 5
changes_count: 1  # One pattern confidence downgrade
convergence_status: "CONVERGED - EVIDENCE DISTILLATION PHASE"

# === MAJOR CHANGE: SELF-CONTAINED EVIDENCE INTEGRATION ===
self_contained_design:
  principle: "Constitution completely self-contained - operator reads and applies without external checking"
  protocol_version: "v2.0 (Persuasion Model)"

  implementation:
    - "Part Va expanded from 392 lines to ~1500 lines"
    - "Comprehensive evidence for all 10 patterns"
    - "Pre-calibrated confidence levels"
    - "Distilled evidence summaries"
    - "Cultural contexts documented"
    - "WEIRD bias assessments explicit"
    - "Known limitations documented"
    - "Application guidance with confidence levels"

  analogy: "Recipe includes cooking times - chef doesn't check food science textbooks while cooking"
