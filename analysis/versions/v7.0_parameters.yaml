# === PATTERN TAXONOMY (New in v7.0) ===
pattern_taxonomy:
  introduced_version: "7.0"
  purpose: "Distinguish universal vs. conditional vs. cultural-specific patterns"

  categories:
    universal:
      definition: "Operate in all cultural contexts (mechanism universal, expression varies)"
      patterns:
        - reciprocity_dynamics
        - deception_compounding
        - truthfulness_enabling_system_health
        - systemic_oppression
        - trauma_as_structural_pattern
        - coordination_failures
        - path_dependence

    conditional:
      definition: "Operate mechanically under specific conditions that may be culturally variable"
      patterns:
        - enforcement_paradoxes
        - information_asymmetry
      note: "Still structural, but context-dependent"

    cultural_specific:
      definition: "Not structural claims, but cultural norms/practices"
      note: "Not included as structural patterns in constitution"

# === META-ANALYTIC DETAIL (Enhanced in v7.0) ===
meta_analytic_detail:
  introduced_version: "7.0"
  applies_to: ["VERY_HIGH", "HIGH"]

  required_elements:
    - meta_analysis_citation: "If available"
    - effect_size: "Aggregate with 95% confidence interval"
    - publication_bias: "Assessment or note"
    - heterogeneity: "I² statistic"
    - sample_size: "Total across studies"
    - landmark_studies: "Key studies by name"

  rationale: "Provides epistemic rigor beyond study counts"
  addressed_concern: "Evidence-Demand Skeptic's primary concern"

# === EVIDENCE SELF-CONTAINMENT (From v6.0, maintained) ===
evidence_integration:
  status: "complete"
  model: "self_contained"
  operator_behavior: "read_and_apply"
  no_external_checking: true
  pre_calibrated_confidence: true

  rationale: "Operator reads and applies patterns directly. All evidence evaluation done during iteration, not during application."
  analogy: "Recipe includes cooking times - chef doesn't check food science textbooks while cooking"

# === FRAMEWORK STRUCTURE ===
document_parts:
  I: "Identity and Foundational Directives"
  II: "Core Behavioral Directives"
  III: "Being Helpful"

  threshold: 0.3

  change_1_consistent_confidence_standards:
    weight: 0.432
    priority: 1
    changes:
      - "Judgment Rebound: HIGH → MODERATE (5-6 contexts, below 7-8+ threshold)"
      - "Information Asymmetry: HIGH → MODERATE (6-7 contexts, conditional pattern)"
      - "Trauma: Clarified HIGH for acute, MODERATE for complex (WEIRD bias in mechanisms)"
      - "Systemic Oppression: Clarified HIGH for observation, MODERATE for mechanisms"
    rationale: "If Enforcement Paradoxes downgraded for WEIRD bias, apply same standard consistently"

  change_2_pattern_taxonomy:
    weight: 0.352
    priority: 2
    added: "Universal vs. Conditional vs. Cultural-Specific distinction"
    rationale: "Clarifies what 'structural pattern' means and prevents over-claiming universality"

  change_3_meta_analytic_detail:
    weight: 0.324
    priority: 3
    added: "Effect sizes, CIs, heterogeneity, meta-analyses for HIGH/VERY_HIGH patterns"

  change_4_maintain_enforcement_moderate:
    weight: 0.378
    priority: 4
    affirmed: "v6.0 downgrade scientifically appropriate"
