# === PATTERN INTEGRATION: INDIVIDUAL + SYSTEMIC ===
pattern_integration:

    systemic: "Part X - 6 patterns (system-level/large-scale)"

  relationships:
    emergence:
      description: "How individual patterns aggregate to systemic effects"
      example: "Individual reciprocity → trust networks → social capital"

    feedback:
      description: "How systemic patterns shape individual behavior"
      example: "Systemic oppression → trauma responses → coping strategies"
