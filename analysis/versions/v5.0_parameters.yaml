# Constitutional Compression Parameters - Version 5.0
# Minimal specification for full reconstruction using invariants + generators

version: "5.0"
date: "2026-01-29"
based_on: "v4.0"
iteration: 4
changes_count: 0  # ZERO constitutional changes
inclusion_rate: 0.000  # 0.0% of proposed changes
convergence_status: "FRAMEWORK CONVERGED"

# === CHANGES FROM v4.0 ===
changes_from_previous:
  constitutional_changes: "NONE - zero proposals met 0.3 threshold"
  only_addition: "Part XIII: Operator Implementation Protocol (not constitutional change)"
  note: "Framework 100% stable in Parts I-XII"

# === OPERATOR IMPLEMENTATION PROTOCOL (New Part XIII) ===
# This is NOT a constitutional change - it's implementation guidance
operator_implementation_protocol:
  added: true
  purpose: "Address 'theory improved, practice inconsistent' gap"
  components:
    - "Confidence calibration checklist (ensures 7-8+ context requirement applied)"
    - "Cultural responsiveness protocol (closes Western bias gap)"
    - "Crisis system safety protocol (acknowledges dangers for vulnerable populations)"
    - "Systematic derivation protocol (no ad-hoc recommendations)"
    - "Implementation verification checklist (quality assurance)"

  rationale: "Framework converged (0% change rate), remaining issues are operator execution"
