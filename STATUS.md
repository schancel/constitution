# Project Status

**Last Updated**: January 29, 2026
**Current Stage**: Protocol Documentation Complete - Ready for v1.0 Design

## Completed

✅ **Repository Setup**
- Git repository initialized
- Directory structure created
- Anthropic's baseline constitution fetched and saved

✅ **Protocol Documentation** (Completed January 29, 2026)
- `experiment/convergence_prompt.md`: Complete protocol with all 25 scenarios, 13 personas, 5-phase process
- `experiment/execution_guide.md`: Detailed step-by-step operational instructions
- All scenarios span relationship advice, decision support, crisis/vulnerability, professional contexts, and edge cases
- All personas span critical dimensions: safety vs. helpfulness, confidence vs. humility, universal vs. cultural, individual vs. systemic, theory vs. practice, vulnerable populations, and framework validation

## Next Steps

1. **Design Constitution v1.0** (NEXT - First Proposed Version)
   - Start from Anthropic's official constitution
   - Add initial proposed changes based on structural moral realism framework
   - Document rationale for changes
   - Save as `constitutions/iterations/v1.0_initial_proposal.md`
   - **Note**: This is iteration 0 (baseline) → v1.0

2. **Run Iteration 1** (v1.0 → v2.0)
   - Execute complete convergence protocol (8-11 hours)
   - Phase 1: Behavioral testing (25 scenarios)
   - Phase 2: Persona critiques (13 personas)
   - Phase 3: Weighted synthesis
   - Phase 4: Convergence assessment
   - Phase 5: Documentation
   - Save results to `results/iteration_1/`

3. **Continue Until Convergence or Divergence**
   - If CONTINUE: Run iteration 2
   - If CONVERGED: Freeze and document success
   - If DIVERGENT: Analyze and reformulate

## Repository History

- January 29, 2026: Initial repository setup with Anthropic's baseline constitution
- January 29, 2026: Experimental framework documented (overview level)
- January 29, 2026: Complete protocol documentation with all scenarios, personas, and procedures
- **Current**: Ready to design constitution v1.0
