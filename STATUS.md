# Project Status

**Last Updated**: January 29, 2026
**Current Stage**: Repository Setup Complete

## Next Steps

1. **Document Complete Protocol** (Before Iteration 1)
   - Expand `experiment/convergence_prompt.md` with full scenarios and personas
   - Expand `experiment/execution_guide.md` with detailed instructions
   - This ensures experiment is reproducible and transparent

2. **Design Constitution v1.0** (First Proposed Version)
   - Start from Anthropic's official constitution
   - Add initial proposed changes based on structural moral realism framework
   - Document rationale for changes
   - Save as `constitutions/iterations/v1.0_initial_proposal.md`

3. **Run Iteration 1** (v1.0 → v2.0)
   - Execute complete convergence protocol
   - Generate all phase outputs
   - Assess convergence
   - Save results to `results/iteration_1/`

4. **Continue Until Convergence or Divergence**
   - If continue: Run iteration 2
   - If converged: Freeze and document success
   - If divergent: Analyze and reformulate

## Repository History

- Initial repository setup with Anthropic's baseline constitution
- Experimental framework documented (overview level)
- Results structure prepared
- Ready for detailed protocol documentation and first iteration

## Key Decisions Pending

- Complete scenario set finalization
- Complete persona descriptions
- Exact weighting formula parameters
- Convergence threshold calibration (0.5 may need adjustment)

These will be determined during protocol documentation phase.
